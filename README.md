> This work is from **Next Level Week** developed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/). Is a first step for many programers (self included) 
and from now the idea is add more features, learn more about the technologies used and be able to create more <br> high level applications.


## Objective

Build an application were people can share information about recycling points anywhere in your current location.


## Installation 

* **Express** for testing local hosting and many others features :
```
npm install express 
```

* **Nodemon** for monitoring. It saves a lot a time because restarts automatically your server once is updated:
```
npm install nodemon 
``` 

* **Nunjucks** is a template engine and can be used for reduce page layout complexity, providing a dinamic application and others. [Learn more](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/): 
```
npm install nunkucs 
```

## Run tests

Go to the project file and write on terminal :

```
npm start 
```

By the way this command is customizable, so you can change any time going in "scripts" on package.json file.

## New features coming up

* Upload images
* Better description about the place, so people can know about the company's/place <br> projects, and also can contact them by emails or phone numbers
* The user can make a request for editing information
* A little box pops up explaning with more details about each item
